# YOU NEED INTELLIJ COMMUNITY 2022.3 I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEW INTELLIJ VERSIONS BUT IT LOOKS TO BE ABSOLUTELY FUCKED THANKS TO WHAT I CAN ONLY PERCIEVE AS VERSION DISCRIMINATION


You may also need this in project settings>SDK>Open JDK 1.8.0_241:
https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1FN9nxH7fh0TvNDssj5qrC2hFcawstPhs&export=download


open gradle console you should see gradle and then a bunch of things, then you want to type

build

then if all goes well go to build/libs and a java file will be there. If you have made edits to the src you want to open the jar file with a archiver tool such as winrar. You can put this compiled class code into mcheli/mcheli in a actual mcheli instance/folder/the yknow mod and test things out yourself. If you want to make sure there are no errors just copy and paste over the mcheli/mcheli with this stuff.

this project is eating me from the inside
